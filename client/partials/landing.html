                  <p>Many people are stuck in a career path and want to change. You might even be one of them.</p>

                  <p>There are far too many people who aren't able to make a career transition for various reasons. Some people aren't aware about the great opportunities that they are qualified for. Others are victims of circumstances or past choices that they made and spend most of their work-life just trying to earn money and stay afloat. Still others are ready to change careers but don't know what steps to take, to get back on track.  Does that sounds like you?

                  Breathe! You're not alone.</p>
          
                  <p><center><strong> We're here to change that.</strong></center> </p>

                  <p>The average American spends 53% of their day at work! When you spend so much time in one place, it's so important to be satisfied! Finding the right job should make you feel content, relaxed, challenged, accomplished, and compelled to go in everyday! </p>

                  <p>We want to help you find this place. But how? By understanding what you like and helping you find a place that will pay you to do it. </p>

For employers, the decision to hire someone is just as complicated.</p> <p><strong>SPEC - G </strong>is a our answer to this complex problem. Our goal is not only to make this an effective solution but to simplfy the process by doing much of the strenuous work for you. </p></br>

                  
                  <p><center><strong> What is SPEC - G? </strong></center> </p>
                  <p>SPEC stands for: <strong> Skills. Personality. Experience. Cultural Fit. </strong> These are just some of the factors that Helper takes into account before suggesting an ideal position for you.</p>
                  <p>The G stands for <strong>Grit</strong>. Are you willing to do what it takes to get the job done? You deserve the opportunity to prove yourself. Listen to Angela Duckworth talk about Grit as an predictor of success via TED Radio on NPR.</p>
